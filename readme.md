A simple PC/Server Case for wall mount

![ProtoPhoto](/blade_proto1.jpg)


## Description

With the advent of LGA1700 based intel silicon, it becomes possible to setup
a bare metal cluster for home labs. As a rack consumes significant space, this
is designed to use a common wall mount track available in big box stores like lowes.

The design is intented to be plasma cut in steel, and reverse rivet nuts will be used as spacers. There is a main plate for the botherboard, a secondary laer for psu and extra disk, and potentially a third layer in acrylic for cover.

## Current State
First proto of main plate has been 3d printed, and initial quotes for stainless steel have been done. Price seems to be on target.

Issues Outstanding:

1. Need to fix up hole sizes for m3
2. Need to change holes to rivet nut and explore insulated ones
3. Need to explore steel thickness or powder coating
